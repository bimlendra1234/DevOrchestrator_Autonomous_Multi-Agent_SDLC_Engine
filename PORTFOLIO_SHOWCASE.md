## 📞 Interview Conversation Starters

**"Tell me about your architecture"**
> "This system uses a multi-agent architecture with three specialized agents coordinated through LangGraph's stateful graph system. Each agent has a specific responsibility: planning, architecture design, and code generation. Communication between agents is type-safe using Pydantic models..."

**"What's the most challenging part?"**
> "The main challenge was ensuring consistent context across agents while maintaining type safety. We solved this by designing strict Pydantic models that enforce the schema of each agent's input and output..."

**"How would you scale this?"**
> "The system is already cloud-native with Docker and Kubernetes support. We can scale horizontally by running multiple worker instances behind a load balancer. For LLM calls, we're using Groq's LPU which already provides sub-100ms latency. We could add caching and queue-based processing for further optimization..."

**"What's next for this project?"**
> "Key improvements: custom model fine-tuning, multi-file diff viewer, team collaboration features, support for more programming languages, and integrations with CI/CD platforms..."
